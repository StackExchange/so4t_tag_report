# Stack Overflow for Teams Tag Report (so4t_tag_report)
A Python script that uses the Stack Overflow for Teams API to create a CSV report of how well each tag is performing. You can see an example of what the output looks like in the Examples directory ([here](https://github.com/StackExchange/so4t_tag_report/blob/main/Examples/tag_metrics.csv)).

For a detailed list of metrics included in the report, see [Metrics in the CSV Report](https://github.com/StackExchange/so4t_tag_report/blob/main/Docs/metrics.md)

## Requirements
* A Stack Overflow for Teams instance (Basic, Business, or Enterprise)
  * If using a version of Stack Overflow Enterprise prior to 2023.3, please use the [2023.2 branch](https://github.com/StackExchangeo/so4t_tag_report/tree/2023.2) instead
* Python 3.9 or higher ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Operating system: Linux, MacOS, or Windows

If using the `--web-client` argument, there are additional requirements (details in [Advanced Usage](https://github.com/StackExchange/so4t_tag_report#--web-client) section)

## Setup

[Download](https://github.com/StackExchange/so4t_tag_report/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack the contents of this repository

**Installing Dependencies**

* Open a terminal window (or, for Windows, a command prompt)
* Navigate to the directory where you unpacked the files
* Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


**API Authentication**

For the Business tier, you'll need a [personal access token](https://stackoverflowteams.help/en/articles/4385859-stack-overflow-for-teams-api) (PAT). You'll need to obtain an API key and an access token for Enterprise. Documentation for creating an Enterprise key and token can be found within your instance at this url: `https://[your_site]/api/docs/authentication`

**Before proceeding, please note a critical step when creating your API Application in Stack Overflow Enterprise for Access Token generation:**

**Generating an Access Token**

To generate an Access Token for Enterprise, you must first ensure your API Application is correctly configured:

* **API Application "Domain" Field Requirement:** When creating your API Application (where you obtain your Client ID and Client Secret), the "Domain" field *must* be populated with the base URL of your Stack Overflow Enterprise instance (e.g., `https://your.so-enterprise.url`). **Although the UI may mark this field as 'Optional,' failure to populate it will prevent Access Token generation and lead to a `"redirect_uri is not configured"` error during the OAuth flow.**

Once your API Application is configured with a valid Domain, follow these steps to generate your Access Token:

* Go to the page where you created your API key. Take note of the "Client ID" associated with your API key.
* Go to the following URL, replacing the base URL, the `client_id`, and the base URL of the `redirect_uri` with your own:
`https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/dialog?client_id=111&redirect_uri=https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success`
* You may be prompted to log in to Stack Overflow Enterprise if you're not already. Either way, you'll be redirected to a page that simply says "Authorizing Application."
* In the URL of that page, you'll find your access token. Example: `https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success#access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

**Note on Access Token Requirements:**
While API v3 now generally allows querying with just an API key for most GET requests, certain paths and data (e.g., `/images` and the email attribute on a `User` object) still specifically require an Access Token for access. If you encounter permissions errors on such paths, ensure you are using an Access Token.


## Basic Usage

In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the script. 
Run the script using the following format, replacing the URL, token, and/or key with your own:
* For Basic and Business: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/TEAM-NAME" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`
* For Enterprise: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`

The script can take several minutes to run, particularly as it gathers data via the API. As it runs, it will update the terminal window with the tasks it performs.

When the script completes, it will indicate that the CSV has been exported, along with the file name. You can see an example of what the output looks like [here](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_tag_report/blob/main/Examples/tag_metrics.csv).

## Advanced Usage

As described below, you can add some additional arguments to the command line to customize the script's behavior. All arguments (and instructions) can also be found by running the `--help` argument: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --help` 

### `--no-api` and `--days`

By default, the CSV report aggregates all historical data for the tags. If you'd like to filter this based on a certain amount of history, the `--days` argument can be used to indicate how many days of history you want to use for the CSV report. If you wanted to pull just the last 90 days worth of data, it would look like this:
`python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN" --days 90`

In conjunction with the `--days` argument, `--no-api` allows you to leverage preexisting JSON data from previous executions of this script. This is significantly faster than running all the API calls again; in fact, it's nearly instantaneous. If you were looking to generate tag metrics based on a variety of time ranges (via `--days`), using the `â€”no-api` argument significantly speeds up the process. 

Example:
* You generate an initial CSV report via the Basic Usage instructions: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`
* an `api_data.json` file is generated and stored locally as part of collecting data via the API. For subsequent script runs where you're trying to generate the report for different time ranges, you can use the preexisting `api_data.json` data by leveraging the `--no-api` argument.
* To quickly generate a CSV report for the past 30 days: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --no-api --days 30`
* Then, you generate a report for the past 90 days: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --no-api --days 90`

Note: when using `--no-api`, the `--url`, `--key`, and `--token` arguments are unecessary. When you'd like to update the JSON data via fresh API calls, simply remove the `no-api` argument and add back the required authentication arguments.

### `--web-client`
The `--web-client` argument allows you to gather additional data from Stack Overflow for Teams, particularly data that is **not** available via the API (yet). 

> **NOTE**: For this specific script feature, you'll need to ensure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer. You'll be prompted with a login window (via Chrome) for your Stack Overflow for Teams instance when the script runs. Once you've logged in, that window will close, and the script will continue to run.

Here are the additional data points that are obtained when scraping is enabled, along with any additional requirements for obtaining those data points:

* The number of configured webhooks (ChatOps notifications) for each tag [Requirements: admin permissions]
* The number of communities associated with a tag. If webhooks are configured for a community, the webhook count will be included in the webhook count for the tag. [Requirements: admin permissions]

To use this function, simply append the `--web-client` argument to the end of the command for running the Python script. Example: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN" --web-client`

### `--proxy`
The `--proxy` argument allows you to use a proxy server to make the API calls. This is useful if you're behind a corporate firewall or if you're running the script on a server that requires a proxy to access the internet.

To use this argument, simply append the `--proxy` argument to the end of the command for running the Python script, including the proxy server's address in the argument. Example: `python3 so4t_tag_report.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN" --proxy "PROXY.EXAMPLE.COM:PORTNUMBER"`

## Support, security, and legal
If you encounter problems using the script, please leave feedback in the Github Issues. You can also clone and change the script to suit your needs. It is provided as-is, with no warranty or guarantee of any kind.

All data is handled locally on the device from which the script is run. The script does not transmit data to other parties, such as Stack Overflow. All of the API calls performed are read only, so there is no risk of editing or adding content on your Stack Overflow for Teams instance.
